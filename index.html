      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Passionate about innovation and driven by impact, I enjoy designing and building solutions that connect people and technology.
        With strong communication skills and a team-oriented mindset, I value collaboration as much as performance.
        I’m constantly learning, whether through academic challenges, group projects or personal exploration.
        My goal is to turn creative ideas into efficient systems that improve everyday life.

          data-description="The Smart Flower Pot project was initiated within the Crysteo robotics club. Through this experience, I explored how software can interact with real-world electronic components to meet practical needs. The system detects when the soil becomes too dry and displays the humidity level on a screen, allowing me to learn how to calibrate sensor thresholds for real-time responses. This project is still ongoing. Eventually, the flower pot will be fully built using 3D printing to house all the electronics in a compact and functional structure. Technologies used: ESP32-S2 MINI, YL-68 Humidity Sensor, TFT LCD 128x160 RGB Display, Arduino IDE, C++."

It was carried out as part of a group class project and aimed to simulate the behavior of an intersection. My teammate and I designed a sequential control model for traffic lights using C++. My main role was to synchronize the lights to ensure a consistent and smooth operation of the simulation."
